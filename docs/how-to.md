# How-to Guides

Read [Available Blocks](blocks.rst) to find out what already exists, then read Assembling Blocks into an App to see how to make an App of these Blocks that can be loaded to a PandABlocks device.

If you need to create a new Block or add to an existing one. Read [Writing a Block](how-to/block.rst) to find out how to specify the interface to a Block, VHDL entity, timing tests and docs.
